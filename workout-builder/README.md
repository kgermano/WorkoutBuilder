<h2>Workout Builder</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This Spring Boot app is a Launchcode capstone project. The workout builder allows a user to sign into their account, choose from a selection of workouts, for example upper body, full body, etc., and then it builds a workout for the user by grabbing individual exercises from the database. 
It then allows the user to save their workout so they can refer back to it at any time, continue to build on those workouts, and create new workouts. </p>

<p>This application was created to help those that want to workout at all different levels. Some users may not know where to start, so this builds a workout for a beginner. Others may be tired of their workout routine and want new exercises, while others really want a place to keep their exercises so they can track what they have done. </p>
